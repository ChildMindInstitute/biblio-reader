Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) has consistently highlighted impaired or
aberrant functional connectivity across brain regions of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
patients. However, the manifestation and neural substrates of these alterations are highly
heterogeneous and often conflicting. Moreover, their neurobiological underpinnings
and etiopathological significance remain largely unknown. A deeper understanding of
the complex pathophysiological cascade leading to aberrant connectivity in ASD can
greatly benefit from the use of model organisms where individual pathophysiological
or phenotypic components of ASD can be recreated and investigated via approaches
that are either off limits or confounded by clinical heterogeneity. Despite some obvious
limitations in reliably modeling the full phenotypic spectrum of a complex developmental
disorder like ASD, mouse models have played a central role in advancing our basic
mechanistic and molecular understanding of this syndrome. Recent progress in mouse
brain connectivity mapping via resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) offers the opportunity to
generate and test mechanistic hypotheses about the elusive origin and significance of
connectional aberrations observed in autism. Here we discuss recent progress toward
this goal, and illustrate initial examples of how the approach can be employed to
establish causal links between ASD-related mutations, developmental processes, and
brain connectional architecture. As the spectrum of genetic and pathophysiological
components of ASD modeled in the mouse is rapidly expanding, the use of rsfMRI can
advance our mechanistic understanding of the origin and significance of the connectional
alterations associated with autism, and their heterogeneous expression across patient
cohorts.

THE CONNECTIVITY THEORY OF AUTISM: OPEN QUESTIONS
AND CONTROVERSIES
Autism is a heterogeneous syndrome characterized by core behavioral features including deficits
in social communication and interaction, as well as restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, and
interests (Association AP, 2013). Although a primary and unitary etiology for autism spectrum
disorder (ASD) has not been identified, its high heritability has been consistently documented,
revealing a contribution of complex and highly heterogeneous genetic mutations (Geschwind,
2009; Geschwind and State, 2015; Sanders et al., 2015). Remarkably, although previously identified
mutations, genetic syndromes, and de novo copy number variations (CNVs) account for about
10–20% of ASD cases, none of these single known genetic causes accounts for more than

Connectivity Mapping in Autism Mouse Models

one, the neurophysiological underpinnings of these connectional
aberrancies are largely unknown, and a causal etiopathological
contribution of specific genetic variants to impaired connectivity
in ASD remains to be firmly established. More broadly,
it is unclear whether these abnormalities are a causative
or epiphenomenal consequence of the disease, and whether
their heterogeneous expression reflects cohort effects, different
genetic etiologies, or neurodevelopmental trajectories. The exact
relationship between connectivity alterations and the severity of
ASD manifestation remains also obscure, with the vast majority
of the human neuroimaging literature being focused on highfunctioning ASD cohorts (Vissers et al., 2012).
A deeper understanding of the origin and significance of
these phenomena is greatly complicated by our very limited
understanding of the neurobiological foundations of macro-scale
neuroimaging readouts commonly employed in ASD research,
such as white matter microstructural parameters (e.g., fractional
anisotropy, Owen et al., 2014) or the elusive functional couplings
underlying rsfMRI-based functional connectivity. This has left
us with a major explanatory gap between mechanistic models
of brain function at the cellular and microcircuit level, and
the emergence of macroscale functional activity in health and
pathological states such as those that are observed in autism.
As a result, we are currently unable to properly interpret and
back-translate clinical evidence of aberrant connectivity into
interpretable neurophysiological events/models that can help
understand, diagnose or treat these disorders. It is also becoming
apparent that a full disambiguation of the multifactorial and
complex determinants of aberrant functional connectivity in
ASD can only be obtained through the combined use of
refined clinical imaging methods and multimodal-multiscale
investigational approaches that currently can only be applied in
experimental animal models.

1–2% of cases (reviewed in Abrahams and Geschwind, 2008).
The phenotypic expression (i.e., “penetrance”) of these genetic
components is also highly variable, ranging from fully penetrant
point mutations to polygenic forms with multiple gene–gene and
gene–environment interactions. Remarkable variability exists
also in the extent of cognitive and behavioral abnormalities
presented by affected individuals (Georgiades et al., 2013; Lai
et al., 2014; Chang et al., 2015), making heterogeneity a dominant
theme for this group of disorders.
The advent of non-invasive brain imaging raised hopes that
such clinical heterogeneity could be narrowed down to a small
number of identifiable “imaging endophenotypes” that could
help ASD diagnosis, patient stratification, and possibly provide
clues as to the elusive etiology of this group of disorders.
Unfortunately, the results of imaging studies have proven overall
as variable as the clinical manifestations of ASD (Stanfield
et al., 2008; Ecker et al., 2015). A notable exception to this
scenario was the initial observation of reduced connectivity
between brain regions in ASD patients, a finding first reported
by Horwitz et al. (1988) using PET, and later corroborated by
task-based (Just et al., 2004) and resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI)
studies (Cherkassky et al., 2006; Kennedy and Courchesne,
2008; Assaf et al., 2010), which revealed impaired long-range
synchronization in spontaneous brain activity. Together with
evidence of reduced white matter connectivity detected with MRI
(reviewed in Anagnostou and Taylor, 2011), these observations
form the basis of the so called “under-connectivity theory
of autism” (Anagnostou and Taylor, 2011; Just et al., 2012),
according to which deficient long-range communication between
brain regions may underlie ASD symptoms and pathophysiology.
However, recent imaging studies have strongly challenged this
view, highlighting a much more heterogeneous picture (see
Vasa et al., 2016 for a recent review). For example, rsfMRI
mapping in a large cohort of patients has revealed the presence
of concomitant hypo- and hyper-connectivity (Di Martino et al.,
2014), although a clear prevalence of hypo-connected regions
was apparent. Similarly, widespread hyper-connectivity during
childhood has also been recently described (Keown et al., 2013;
Supekar et al., 2013; Uddin et al., 2013a), suggesting a possible
neurodevelopmental origin for these alterations. More recently,
the hypothesis that such conflicting findings could reflect greater
inter-subject variability in ASD patients than in neurotypical
controls (i.e., idiosyncratic connectivity) has been proposed
(Hahamy et al., 2015). A putative confounding contribution of
ASD-related motion and its effect on functional connectivity
readouts is also the subject of an open controversy in the imaging
community (Deen and Pelphrey, 2012; Power et al., 2012, 2015;
Pardoe et al., 2016).
Collectively, the extensive literature published to date points
at the presence of major functional connectivity alterations
in ASD populations, although the identified regional patterns
vary considerably across studies and patient cohorts (Kana
et al., 2011; Müller, 2014; Ecker and Murphy, 2014; Ameis
and Catani, 2015; Ecker et al., 2015; Bernhardt et al., 2016;
Vasa et al., 2016). Despite this rapidly accumulating evidence,
many fundamental questions as to the origin and significance
of connectional alterations in ASD remain unanswered. For

BRIDGING THE GAP: FUNCTIONAL
CONNECTIVITY MAPPING IN MOUSE
AUTISM MODELS
The identification of several high-confidence ASD-risk genes
involved in syndromic forms of autism (Sanders et al., 2015) has
been paralleled by the generation of mouse lines recapitulating
human mutations. Despite predictable limitations in reliably
modeling the full phenotypic spectrum of a complex (and
possibly only human) developmental disorder like ASD, mouse
models can be harnessed to understand how genetic alterations
translate into relevant changes in cells and circuits, and ultimately
to identify points of convergence for molecular pathways, cells,
circuits, and systems that may result in a deeper understanding
of the pathophysiology of ASD and related behavioral deficits
(Arguello and Gogos, 2012; Nelson and Valakh, 2015; Vasa
et al., 2016). For example, molecular investigations in ASD
mouse models have been instrumental in the identification
of a limited set of molecular pathways to which ASDinvolved genes seem to converge, including, among others,
synaptogenesis, synaptic function, and neuronal translational
regulation (reviewed in de la Torre-Ubieta et al., 2016). This

Connectivity Mapping in Autism Mouse Models

One notable experimental advantage of mouse imaging with
respect to current human imaging genetic approaches is the
possibility of mapping and comparing the effect of multiple
mutations (via the use of different autism mouse models) under
rigorously controlled experimental conditions, thus reducing the
confounding contribution of experimental variables that can be
only minimally controlled in human research, such as genetic
and environmental variability, age (Uddin et al., 2013b), ASDrelated motion, and group differences in cognitive states (Vasa
et al., 2016). The main goal of this line of investigation is
to assess whether seemingly unrelated ASD-risk mutations do
converge on a limited number of distinct functional connectivity
endophenotypes. An elegant demonstration of this approach
has been recently described using morpho-anatomical MRI.
Brain-volumetric phenotypes of 26 ASD mouse models as
defined by structural MRI methods exhibited clustering into
three main groups, each with a distinct set of concomitant
changes in size across different brain regions (Ellegood et al.,
2015). Such reduction of morpho-anatomical heterogeneity is not
surprising, given the wide (and sometimes opposing) stream of
pathophysiological alterations observed in syndromic forms of
autism, which range from basic molecular or synaptic mechanism
such as protein synthesis (Geschwind and Levitt, 2007; Auerbach
et al., 2011) up to homeostatic regulations of excitatory
and inhibitory neurotransmission (Nelson and Valakh, 2015).
Analogous analyses with regards to functional connectivity
phenotypes should be possible in the future to associate
basic pathophysiological traits with macroscale connectional
aberrancies.
A second main line of investigation is the combined use
of mouse rsfMRI and multiscale neurobiological techniques to
obtain a mechanistic description of ASD-related phenotypes
and pathophysiological pathways leading to aberrant functional
connectivity. This research can include, but is not limited to,
a deeper investigation of syndromic ASD mutations associated
with specific pathological traits [e.g., Tuberous Sclerosis 2 as
a key mediator of impaired autophagy and increased synaptic
density (Tang et al., 2014)], and can possibly be extended
to investigate risk factors that have been also more loosely
implicated in autism. This research effort may generate crucial
mechanistic information that can be used to back-translate
clinical evidence of aberrant connectivity into interpretable
neurophysiological events/models that can help understand,
diagnose, or treat these disorders. A brief description of initial
steps toward these two main goals is reported in the next two
sections.

effort has been accompanied by the development of ASD-relevant
behavioral phenotyping assays, primarily targeted at social,
communication, and repetitive behaviors (Silverman et al., 2010a;
Wöhr and Scattoni, 2013; Kas et al., 2014; Homberg et al.,
2016). Interestingly, many—but not all—models showed autismlike traits, with manifestations ranging from repetitive behaviors
to reduced social communication (ultrasonic vocalizations)
and social interest (reviewed in Ellegood and Crawley, 2015).
However, despite the widespread application and high face
validity of ASD behavioral phenotyping, the significance and
translational relevance of mouse behavioral alterations to human
ASD remain debated (Wöhr and Scattoni, 2013) and should be
extrapolated with caution.
Recent advances in mouse rsfMRI mapping (reviewed
in Gozzi and Schwarz, 2016) offer the opportunity of
extending mouse modeling of ASD to the investigation
of the neurobiological underpinnings and etiopathological
significance of ASD-related connectivity aberrations. Specifically,
improvements in MRI imaging hardware, together with tighter
control of physiological and motion artifacts (Weber et al.,
2006; Ferrari et al., 2012) have led to robust and reproducible
identification of homotopic rsfMRI networks covering known
cortical and subcortical systems in the mouse by several research
groups (Mechling et al., 2014; Nasrallah et al., 2014; Sforazzini
et al., 2014; Zerbi et al., 2015; Shah et al., 2016). Interestingly,
distributed networks encompassing heteromodal prefrontal and
posterior cortical regions have also been identified (Sforazzini
et al., 2014; Zerbi et al., 2015; Shah et al., 2016), leading to
the suggestive hypothesis of the presence of evolutionary
precursors of the human salience network and default mode
network (DMN) in this species (reviewed in Gozzi and Schwarz,
2016). This notion is empirically corroborated by the recent
observation that cytoarchitecturally homologous regions such
as anterior cingulate and retrosplenial cortices (Vogt and
Paxinos, 2014) similarly serve as connectivity hubs in humans
and mice (Cole et al., 2010; Tomasi and Volkow, 2011; Liska
et al., 2015). Moreover, the application of rsfMRI to the mouse
brain comes with several important advantages, including the
possibility to use quantitative imaging modalities for an objective
endo-phenotypic characterization of ASD-related pathology
complementary to behavioral assays, and to validate its readouts
with invasive techniques that are off limits for human research,
including local field potentials (LFPs) coherence mappings (Zhan
et al., 2014), local injection of neuronal tracers (Sforazzini et al.,
2016), as well as an ever-increasing array of histopathological,
stereological,
or
immunohistochemical
post-mortem
analyses.
Collectively, these correspondences strongly support the use
of rsfMRI as a means to bridge research of functional connectivity
aberrancies in autism across species (human vs. mouse) and
levels of inquiry (from cellular- and microscale to meso- and
macroscale, Figure 1), along two main investigational routes.
First, rsfMRI can be used to establish causal (rather than
associative) etiopathological contributions between specific ASDassociated genetic variants and macroscale connectivity, thus
complementing analogous clinical research efforts using imaging
genetics (Scott-Van Zeeland et al., 2010; Rudie et al., 2012).

FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY MAPPING
IN GENETIC MODELS OF AUTISM
An outstanding question in ASD connectivity studies is
whether genetic mutations associated with syndromic forms of
autism are sufficient to produce aberrant macroscale functional
connectivity. Initial mouse rsfMRI studies seem to corroborate
this hypothesis. Specifically, Haberl and colleagues have recently
investigated functional and structural connectivity in the

Connectivity Mapping in Autism Mouse Models

FIGURE 1 | Mouse imaging can bridge the gap between microscale models of brain function and clinical research of macroscale functional
connectivity. Mouse models provide a powerful reductive platform that can be employed to link etiological determinants of ASD, such as syndromic mutation or
neurodevelopmental traits, to basic molecular and cellular signatures of pathology (left, top to down). However, until recently we have been unable to use this
approach to study the neurobiological underpinnings of macroscale functional connectivity, owing to difficulty in translating models of brain function across levels of
inquiry. This results in a major explanatory gap between clinical research (heavily relying on macroscale neuroimaging measures of brain function, such as rsfMRI) and
preclinical neurobiological investigation in rodent models (bottom, right). The implementation of functional connectivity mapping via rsfMRI in the mouse (right) can
bridge this gap, by permitting to causally relate connectional changes with basic molecular or cellular processes, and by permitting a direct translation of these
findings from and to humans owing to the shared biophysical principle underlying these measurements (figure adapted from Arguello and Gogos, 2012; Anticevic
et al., 2013 with permission).

Fmr1−/y model of fragile X syndrome (FXS; Budimirovic and
Kaufmann, 2011) and described connectional aberrations in
sensory networks (Haberl et al., 2015). These included reduced
structural integrity of the corpus callosum and an increase in
local connectivity of the primary visual cortex, as probed by
viral tracers, an effect accompanied by reduced rsfMRI coupling
between visual and other neighboring sensory cortical regions.
The authors suggested that the observed decoupling could
explain sensory processing defects that are often observed in FXS
patients (Boyd et al., 2010).
In another recent study, homozygous mice lacking the ASDrisk gene CNTNAP2 (Peñagarikano et al., 2011) exhibited
reduced long-range and local functional connectivity in cingulate
and prefrontal regions (Liska et al., 2016), two key heteromodal
areas of the mouse brain previously characterized as functional
connectivity hubs, owing to their rich connectivity with other
brain areas (Liska et al., 2015). Interestingly, impaired anteroposterior prefrontal connectivity between components of the
mouse DMN was associated with reduced social investigation,
a behavioral measure regarded as a core “autism trait” in mice
(Wöhr and Scattoni, 2013). This finding recapitulates analogous
imaging results obtained in human carriers of CNTNAP2 gene
polymorphisms (Scott-Van Zeeland et al., 2010), hence providing
a first example of the translational value of this approach. This

finding is consistent with the presence of impaired GABAergic
neurotransmission in these animals (Peñagarikano et al., 2011),
a trait that could result in aberrant oscillatory rhythms. It is
interesting to note that analogous prefrontal hypo-connectivity
has been observed using rsfMRI in BTBR mice, an idiopathic
model of autism characterized by agenesis of the corpus callosum
and by analogous excitatory/inhibitory imbalances (Sforazzini
et al., 2016).
rsfMRI mapping has also been recently carried out in a
mouse model of human 15q13.3 microdeletion, a CNV associated
with schizophrenia, intellectual disability, and ASD (Shinawi
et al., 2009). Compared to wild-type mice, 15q13.3 mice
showed widespread patterns of hyper-connectivity along the
hippocampal-prefrontal axis, a network commonly affected in
schizophrenic patients (Gass et al., 2016). Notably, Gass and
colleagues also showed that aberrant functional connectivity
could be acutely rescued by pharmacological stimulation of
nicotinic acetylcholine alpha 7 receptors, in keeping with
a contribution of this mechanism to the development of
schizophrenia-related phenotypes in these mice (Gass et al.,
2016). Although the phenotypic traits of this mouse line appear
to be more closely related to schizophrenia rather than to ASD
(Fejgin et al., 2014), the results of this study are important as they
show that CNVs and genetic alterations with partial penetrance

LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE
PERSPECTIVES

to ASD could produce divergent connectional phenotypes
(e.g., hyper- and hypo-connectivity), suggesting a plausible
contribution of genetic heterogeneity to some of the discrepant
imaging findings in humans. Importantly, these initial mouse
studies argue against an artifactual (e.g., motion-driven) origin
of connectivity aberrations reported in human ASD research,
because the use of light sedation in mice along with artificial
ventilation allows for the acquisition of virtually motion-free
images.

Like any other experimental approach, mouse rsfMRI is
accompanied by limitations that should be taken into account
when the approach is used to investigate the basis of connectivity
alterations in ASD. First and foremost, as mouse rsfMRI
experiments normally employ sedation to minimize stress and
motion of animals during scans, the contribution of possible
genotype-dependent differences in sensitivity to anesthesia
(Petrinovic et al., 2016) should be controlled. The fact that to
date only a minority of studies (Zhan et al., 2014; Liska et al.,
2016; Sforazzini et al., 2016) have reported genotype-dependent
measures of anesthesia sensitivity is a factor for concern, as
differences in anesthesia depth/sensitivity can affect connectivity
strength and distribution of the imaged networks (Nasrallah
et al., 2014). The impact of anesthesia per-se as a putative modifier
of intrinsic connectional architecture appears to be less of an
issue, as a large body of human and rodent research shows
that, under light controlled sedation, the regional patterns of
functional correlation seem to be largely preserved (reviewed
in Gozzi and Schwarz, 2016). As pointed out in previous work,
a rigorous control of motion and physiological state is also
of paramount importance to obtain reliable network mapping
(Jonckers et al., 2015; Gozzi and Schwarz, 2016). It should also be
mentioned that, although the field is still lacking in standardized
protocols and methods that would facilitate comparison of
experimental results across studies and sites, this issue is receiving
increased attention and collaborative efforts are underway to
address it.
The initial studies described here represent only the first step
toward a greater understanding of the origin and underpinnings
of connectional alterations in ASD. Future investigations are
required to describe commonalities and differences between
brain functional networks in the mouse and human from
multiple points of view, including topology (Sporns and Betzel,
2016; van den Heuvel et al., 2016a), biological underpinnings
(Richiardi et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015; van den Heuvel
et al., 2016b), and functional equivalence (Li et al., 2015).
Similarly, studies of additional genetic etiologies associated with
ASDs, covering heterogeneous pathophysiological pathways, are
crucial to achieve a deeper understanding of whether the
connectional signatures are mutation specific or can be regarded
as a generalizable phenomenon. When coupled to analogous
clinical efforts aimed at identification of connectional aberrancies
in genetically homogeneous populations [e.g., 16p11.2 deletion
(Simons Vip Consortium, 2012; Owen et al., 2014)], the method
can also be used to investigate the cellular and physiological
basis of clinically relevant neuroimaging readouts and, via a
comparison between human and mouse imaging findings, to
obtain an assessment of the translational and construct validity
of mouse models of ASD. The developmental trajectory of
these alterations could in principle also be investigated in
mouse models, although critical limitations in the accuracy of
physiological control in young mice and pups exist.
Much of mouse ASD modeling has been so far primarily
addressed at monogenic ASD syndromes, which represent ∼10%

NEUROBIOLOGICAL PATHWAYS LEADING
TO ABERRANT FUNCTIONAL
CONNECTIVITY
A few recent studies have provided important mechanistic
investigations of ASD-relevant phenotypes associated with
aberrant functional connectivity. In the first of such studies,
Zhan et al. (2014) investigated whether deficits in synaptic
pruning, a putative pathophysiological determinant of autism
(Hutsler and Zhang, 2010), result in connectivity alterations. To
probe this hypothesis, the authors measured rsfMRI connectivity
in Cx3cr1KO mice, a mouse line characterized by microgliadependent synaptic pruning deficits as a result of deficient
neuronal-microglia signaling (Paolicelli et al., 2011). Synaptic
pruning deficits in Cx3cr1KO were found to be associated
with long-range functional connectivity impairments, a finding
corroborated by LFPs coherence recordings in freely-behaving
animals. Interestingly, the authors also showed that impaired
pruning was associated with core mouse “autism traits,” and
that long-range fronto-hippocampal connectivity was a good
predictor of social behavior. This study is of special importance,
as it was the first to suggest a role for dysfunctional synaptic
maturation in shaping long-range functional synchronization
and to postulate a contribution of immune system mediators to
this cascade. Empirical evidence in support of this hypothesis
comes from another recent study (Kim et al., 2016), where
analogous phenotypes where observed in mice characterized by
defective autophagy in microglia, including increased synaptic
density, impaired social activity, and a trend for impaired
connectivity between posterior-sensory and prefrontal regions.
Similarly, Filiano et al. (2016) recently showed that deficiency in
interferon-γ, a key immune signaling protein, is associated with
social deficits and frontal rsfMRI hyper-connectivity in SCID
mice, thus corroborating a putative mechanistic link between
immune dysfunction, impaired social behavior, and functional
connectivity. Although promising and mechanistically relevant,
these initial results should be extrapolated to autism research with
great caution, as a pathophysiological contribution of immune
and microglia deficits to ASD has yet to be unambiguously
demonstrated (Estes and McAllister, 2015). They, however,
powerfully illustrate how the combined use of rsfMRI, mouse
genetics and state-of-the-art neuro-biological approaches can
elucidate pathways leading to aberrant functional connectivity,
an approach that can be extended to investigate the role
of multiple ASD-relevant pathophysiological factors, including
syndromic genetic mutations.

Connectivity Mapping in Autism Mouse Models

connectivity alterations are an underlying cause of observed
behavioral deficits, then behavioral phenotypic “rescue”
should be accompanied by normalized patterns of brain
functional connectivity. This research could indicate whether
connectivity alterations are necessary for the expression of
ASD-related behaviors in mice, or are instead an epiphenomenal
manifestation of underlying pathophysiology, thus providing
an empirical assessment of the pathophysiological relevance
of connectivity aberrancies in ASD. “Rescue” studies may also
help identify putative endo-phenotypes (complementary to
behavior) that could serve as measurable readouts for early
clinical translation and evaluation of novel ASD treatments in
genetically defined autism syndromes (Smucny et al., 2014).
In conclusion, functional imaging of the mouse has now
reached a turning point such that accurate modeling and
investigation of ASD-connectivity aberrations is currently
possible, via the use of readouts amenable to direct translation
to human research (e.g., rsfMRI). Despite caveats, in the next
few years the approach is poised to offer breakthroughs in our
understanding of the pathogenesis of ASD-related connectivity
aberrancies, possibly bringing some order to the intricate and
often contradictory body of research detailing connectional
alterations in patient populations.

of ASDs (Silverman et al., 2010a; Nelson and Valakh, 2015).
The recapitulation, in mice, of high-confidence genetic etiologies
associated with ASD offers the opportunity to probe specific
hypotheses about circuit dysfunction and ASD pathology that
can be directly extrapolated to homologous clinical populations
[e.g., 16p11.2 microdeletion (Simons Vip Consortium, 2012;
Owen et al., 2014)]. An important limitation of current ASD
translational research is its inability to reliably model “idiopathic”
autism, which is the most frequent diagnostic label for ASDrelated behavioral manifestations. Attempts to use forward
genetic approaches in inbred mouse lines exhibiting ASD-like
behaviors without a specific genetic determinant have been
proposed, with the inbred BTBR mouse line probably being
the most notable example in the field (Silverman et al., 2010b;
Gogolla et al., 2014; Squillace et al., 2014). Translational relevance
of neuro-behavioral findings obtained by comparing genetically
homogeneous inbred lines like asocial BTBR and “normosocial”
B6 mice is, however, debated (Dodero et al., 2013; Squillace
et al., 2014). Nevertheless, novel neuromolecular approaches and
the use of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients
have begun to reveal common downstream neurobiological
pathways in idiopathic forms of autism characterized by shared
neuroanatomical features [e.g., macrocephaly (Nicolini et al.,
2015; Marchetto et al., 2016)]. Controlled manipulation of
such signaling and molecular pathways in animal models is
a foreseeable strategy that can be employed to expand our
translational framework to the investigation of macroscale brain
network aberrancies in idiopathic forms of ASD.
Finally, studies in which connectivity alterations are
pharmacologically or genetically rescued may help clarify
the relevance of functional connectional alterations to ASD
pathology and its behavioral manifestations. Specifically, if
