> Our company records a speech sample from a patient through a recording device (e.g. iPhone), and then does analysis on that waveform (.mp3) and the text transcribed from that waveform (.txt document) to detect health abnormalities. Our servers output a report, like in a blood test with extracted features and standard reference ranges, which could be used to infer health abnormalities from the speech sample. These reports can be used in combination with existing surveys (e.g. the PHQ-9) to equip physicians with added insight to treat patients across an array of health conditions.
