### Wang, S., Jiang, M., Duchesne, X. M., Laugeson, E. A., Kennedy, D. P., Adolphs, R., & Zhao, Q. (2015). Atypical visual saliency in autism spectrum disorder quantified through model-based eye tracking. Neuron, 88(3), 604-616.
### Conclusion
ASD children look more at image centers, even when there is no object at the center. They fixated more on regions of pixel-level saliency and were quicker to fixate on objects rather than faces, showing atypical visual attention across multiple levels and categories of objects
